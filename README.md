Zipfs Law and Segmenting by Vowels
==================================

The python script `seg_by_vowel.py` segments the Brown Corpus into chunks based on a few different delimiters.

* space
* a, e, i, o and u

The space delimiter chunks the Brown corpus into pieces equivalent to orthographic words. The vowel delimiters chunk the corpus into non-word sequences that even include whitespace characters.
